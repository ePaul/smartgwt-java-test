Inheriting this module injects the PluginBridges Javascript file. This module inherits the default com.smartgwt.SmartGwt
module which in turn injects all the other SmartClient JS files with the the Enterprise theme.

If you want mode control over what JavaScript files are included, inherit SmartGwtNoScript instead
and manually add the sc/modules/ISC_PluginBridges.js script include in your host html file.
