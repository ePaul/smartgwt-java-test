/**
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.OperationBinding#getDataProtocol dataProtocol} affects how the data in the DSRequest
 * ({@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest#getData data})
 *  is sent to the {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource#getDataURL dataURL}.  Listed below are the valid values for
 *  {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.OperationBinding#getDataProtocol dataProtocol} and their behavior.
 *  <P>
 *  Note that, when using the Smart GWT server, data is automatically translated from
 *  JavaScript to Java according to the rules described {@link com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCRequest#getData here};
 *  dataProtocol does not apply and is ignored.
 *  <P>
 *  If you are integrating with a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.RestDataSource REST} server that requires the more
 * obscure {@link com.smartgwt.client.rpc.RPCRequest#getHttpMethod httpMethod}s of "PUT", "DELETE" or "HEAD", you can
 * specify these
 * httpMethod settings via {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.OperationBinding#getRequestProperties requestProperties}. 
 * dataProtocol settings
 *  that mention "GET" or "POST" are compatible with these additional HTTP methods as well.
 *  Typical {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource#getOperationBindings operationBindings} for a REST server that uses
 *  "PUT" and "DELETE" are as follows:
 *  <pre>
 *     operationBindings:[
 *        {operationType:"fetch", dataProtocol:"getParams"},
 *        {operationType:"add", dataProtocol:"postParams"},
 *        {operationType:"remove", dataProtocol:"getParams", requestProperties:{httpMethod:"DELETE"}},
 *        {operationType:"update", dataProtocol:"postParams", requestProperties:{httpMethod:"PUT"}}
 *     ],
 *  </pre>
