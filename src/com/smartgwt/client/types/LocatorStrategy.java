/**
 * The AutoTest subsystem relies on generating and parsing identifier strings to identify components on the page. A very
 * common pattern is identifying a specific component within a list of possible candidates. There are many many cases where
 * this pattern is used, for example - members in a layout,tabs in a tabset, sections in a section stack. <P> In order to
 * make these identifiers as robust as possible across minor changes to an application, (such as skin changes, minor layout
 * changes, etc) the system will store multiple pieces of information about a component when generating an identification
 * string to retrieve it from a list of candidates. The system has a default strategy for choosing the order in which to
 * look at these pieces of information but in some cases this can be overridden by setting a <code>LocatorStrategy</code>.
 * <p> By default we use the following strategies in order to identify a component from a list of candidates:
 * <UL><li><code>name</code>: Does not apply in all cases but in cases where a specified   <code>name</code> attribute has
 * meaning we will use it - for example for  {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.layout.SectionStackSection#getName sections
 * in a section stack}.</li> <li><code>title</code>: If a title is specified for the component this may be used   as a
 * legitimate identifier if it is unique within the component - for example   differently titled tabs within a tabset.</li>
 * <li><code>index</code>: Locating by index is typically less robust than by name or   title as it is likely to be
 * effected by layout changes on the page.</li> </UL> If an explicit strategy is specified, that will be used to locate the
 * component if  possible. If no matching component is found using that strategy, we will continue to try the remaining
 * strategies in order as described above. In other words setting a locatorStrategy to "title" will skip attempting to find
 * a component by name, and instead attempt to find by title - or failing that by index. <P> Note that we also support
 * matching by type (see {@link com.smartgwt.client.types.LocatorTypeStrategy}). Matching by type is used if we were unable
 * to match by name or title or to disambiguate between multiple components with a matching title.
