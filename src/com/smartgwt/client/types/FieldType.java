/**
 * The types listed below are built-in types that {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.DataBoundComponent databound
 * components} understand and treat specially (using type-specific form controls, validators, formatters, sorting logic,
 * etc).   <P> You can declare custom types via {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.SimpleType SimpleType.create()}, with
 * settings that will influence DataBound components.  You can also create your own subclasses of databound components to
 * add further custom, reusable behaviors based on field.type. <P> <code>field.type</code> can also be the ID of another
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource}, which allows you to model nested structures such as XML documents (in fact,
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.XMLTools#loadXMLSchema XMLTools.loadXMLSchema} models XML schema in this way).  Nested
 * DataSource declarations affect how XML and JSON data is deserialized into JavaScript objects in the  {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.ClientDataIntegration client-side integration} pipeline, so that you can load complex XML
 * documents and have them deserialized into a correctly typed JavaScript object model. <P> Note: to declare related but
 * <i>separate</i> objects, as in an "Account" object that can be related to both a "Contact" object and "Order" objects,
 * use {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getForeignKey foreignKey}, <b>not</b> a nested structure
 * declaration.
