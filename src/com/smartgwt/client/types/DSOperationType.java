 * Elsewhere called CRUD operations, where CRUD stands for "create", "retrieve", "update", "delete", which correspond to
 * "add", "fetch", "update" and "remove" in Smart GWT terminology.  See {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.docs.DataSourceOperations} for a full description. <p> There is also a fifth operation, "custom". 
 * This is any operation that is not one of the  four CRUD operations.  You can use operations of this type in
 * circumstances where you  might otherwise have used a plain RPC.
