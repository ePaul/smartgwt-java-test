/**
 * <h3>Tree DataBinding</h3>
 * The Smart GWT {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeGrid} component is a visual representation of a tree and
 * requires a {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree} or ResultTree datatype passed via the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeGrid#getData data} attribute to initialize the tree view.  The {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree} datatype is used when you want to provide all of the tree nodes in one shot at
 * initialization time.  The ResultTree datatype is used when you want portions of the tree to be loaded on demand from the
 * server. <p> <b><u>Providing all data to the Tree at creation</u></b> <p> The simplest mechanism by which to initialize a
 * Tree is to simply provide all the data up-front when the Tree itself is created.  Depending on the format of your tree
 * data, this can be done by setting {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getRoot root} or {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getData data}.  This functionality is provided by the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree} class. <p> For examples of this type of databinding, see the following SDK
 * examples: <ul> <li><a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/#tree_databinding_children_arrays"
 * target="examples">TreeGrid Initialization Example</a></li>  </ul> <p> <b><u>Loading Tree nodes on demand</u></b> <p> In
 * this mode, tree nodes are loaded on-demand the first time a user expands a folder.  This approach is necessary for large
 * trees.  This functionality is provided by the ResultTree class, which uses a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource}
 * to load data from the server.  Each DataSource Record becomes a {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeNode}. <p>
 * ResultTrees require that every node in the tree have an {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getIdField id} that
 * is unique tree-wide.  When the user expands a folder whose contents have not yet been loaded from the server (or you
 * programmatically call openFolder() on such a node), the client automatically sends a {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest} to the server to ask for all immediate children of that node.  The {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DSRequest} criteria will specify the id of the node for which children are being requested via
 * the <code>parentId</code> property (see {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getParentIdField parentIdField}).
 * This client is asking the server: "give me all nodes whose parentId is the id of this node". <P> If there are no
 * pre-existing node ids in the dataset you are loading, you must generate node ids (because the client needs some way to
 * identify nodes when talking to the server). Generally a node id should contain whatever information is required to fetch
 * the node and it's children on the server.  One typical approach is to use the path to the node as a node id.  For XML
 * datasets in particular, the path may be a valid XPath, so that server-side lookup of child nodes is just a matter of
 * applying the node id as an XPath to a server-side XMLDocument. <P> ResultTrees are created for you by the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeGrid} when you set {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeGrid#getDataSource
 * dataSource}, but you can pass an initial dataset to a databound TreeGrid by setting {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeGrid#getInitialData initialData}.  The {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getIdField idField} is derived from the dataSource you provide to the TreeGrid -
 * the first field marked as {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getPrimaryKey primaryKey}:true becomes the
 * idField of the ResultTree. The {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getParentIdField parentIdField} is found by
 * looking for a field that has a {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getForeignKey foreignKey} property
 * pointing to the idField. <P> If you do not provide {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.TreeGrid#getInitialData
 * initialData}, the first DSRequest you receive will be a request for the nodes under root.  The id of the root node of
 * the tree is the value of the <code>rootValue</code> attribute on the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getParentIdField parentIdField} of the Tree DataSource.  <p> For examples of this
 * type of databinding, see the following SDK examples: <ul> <li><a
 * href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/#tree_databinding_init_ondemand" target="examples">TreeGrid
 * DataBinding Example</a></li>  </ul> <P> <b><u>Multi-Level load on demand</u></b> <P> The ResultTree's DSRequests ask for
 * the immediate children of a node only (by specifying <code>parentId</code> in the criteria). Any nodes returned whose
 * <code>parentId</code> field value is unset or matches this criterion will be added to the tree as immediate children of
 * the node. However you are also free to return multiple levels of children.  This can be done by simply returning a flat
 * list of descendents with valid id's and parentId's, exactly as though  you were initializing a multi-level tree via
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.tree.Tree#getData data}.   <P> Note that when receiving multiple levels of children,
 * the ResultTree's assumption is that if any children are loaded for a parent, then that parent is considered fully
 * loaded. <P> When loading children for a given parent node, the ResultTree calls {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource#fetchData DataSource.fetchData} on its DataSource.  For custom code that may need to
 * reference the parentNode or tree in some way, the parent node whose children are being loaded is available on the
 * dsRequest instance in the DataSource flow as dsRequest.parentNode, where it can be inspected during {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSource#transformRequest DataSource.transformRequest}.
