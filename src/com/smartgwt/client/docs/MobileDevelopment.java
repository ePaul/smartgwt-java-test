/**
 * <h3>Mobile Application Development</h3>
 * Smart GWT supports building web applications that can be accessed by mobile devices that support modern web browsers,
 * specifically: <ul> <li> Safari on iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) <li> Android's default (WebKit-based) browser
 * <li> Windows Phone 7 (future, for 'Mango' and up) <li> Blackberry devices that use a WebKit-based browser (future) </ul>
 * Via "packaging" technologies such as Titanium and Phonegap, a Smart GWT web application can be +link{packaged as an
 * installable native application,nativeMobileApps} that can be delivered via the "App Store" for the target mobile
 * platform.  Applications packaged in this way have access to phone-specific data and services such as contacts stored on
 * the phone, or the ability to invoke the device's camera. <P> <h3>Finger / touch events</h3> <P> Mobile and touch devices
 * support "touch events" that correspond to finger actions on the screen.  By default, Smart GWT simply sends touch events
 * to UI components as normal mouse events.  Specifically: <ul> <li> a finger tap gesture will trigger mouseDown, mouseUp
 * and click events <li> a touch-and-slide interaction will trigger drag and drop, firing the normal Smart GWT     
 * sequence of dragStart, dragMove, and dragStop <li> a touch-and-hold interaction will trigger a contextMenu event, and
 * will trigger a hover      if no contextMenu is shown </ul> This means that most applications that are written initially
 * to target desktop computers need little or no modification in order be able to run on tablet-sized devices (eg the
 * iPad).  For handset-sized devices (phones, iPod touch), conditional logic may need to be added to make different use of
 * the screen real estate. <P> <h3>Mobile look and feel</h3> <P> The "Mobile" skin should be used whenever mobile devices
 * are detected.  This skin roughly mimics the appearance of the iOS default widgets wherever there is an iOS widget that
 * corresponds closely to a given Smart GWT widget.  It also makes extensive use of CSS3 to minimize the use of images
 * while still providing an attractive look and feel. <P> In addition, this skin also changes the behavior of some Smart
 * GWT widgets to match the UI idioms common on mobile devices.  For example, the TabSet component switches to
 * bottom-oriented tabs, which are flush together (no gaps).  If there are more than a certain number of tabs, a special
 * "More" tab appears which lists other remaining tabs.  Among other examples, this is the behavior of the "iPad"
 * application on iOS devices, and is an efficient use of minimal screen real estate which feels natural when used on a
 * mobile device. <P> In order to detect whether to use the Mobile skin, because of the rapid proliferation of mobile
 * devices, we recommend using server-side detection based on the User-Agent HTTP header, and using conditional logic (such
 * as logic in a .jsp) to load the "Mobile" skin specifically for these devices. <P> <h3>Adapting to Screen Size and
 * Orientation Change</h3> <P> Safari on the Apple iPod/iPhone supports explicitly configuring the viewport as detailed
 * here: <a
 * href='http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html'
 * onclick="window.open('http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html');return
 * false;">http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html</a>.
 * Including these meta tags in your bootstrap HTML file will allow you to set  a default "zoom level" - how many pixels
 * show up on the screen in landscape or portrait mode as well as disabling the user's standard zoom interactions. We also
 * have  {@link com.smartgwt.client.util.Page#updateViewport an API} to configure the viewport programmatically at runtime.
 * <P> Note that the {@link com.smartgwt.client.util.Page#getOrientation Page.getOrientation} API may be used to determine
 * the current orientation of the application, and {@link com.smartgwt.client.types.PageEvent the page orientationChange
 * event} will fire whenever the user rotates the screen allowing applications to directly respond to the user pivoting
 * their device.
