/**
 * <h3>Uploading Files</h3>
 * Smart GWT provides special client and server-side support for file upload that allows uploaded files to be treated like
 * ordinary DataSource fields.  This includes: <ul> <li>the {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FileItem} and
 * {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.MultiFileItem} FormItems that enable users to upload one or more files as
 * a background operation, without leaving the current page <li>server-side support that allows binary uploads to be
 * treated as a normal DataSource field values, with all other aspects of server-side integration unchanged <li>built-in
 * SQL DataSource support that can store and retrieve uploaded files from SQL databases </ul> The following documentation
 * assumes you are using the Smart GWT Java Server.  If you are not, skip to the sections near the end of this document.
 * <P> <b>Single file upload: "binary" field type</b> <P> To use Smart GWT's client-server upload system, you use a
 * DataSource field of {@link com.smartgwt.client.data.DataSourceField#getType type} "binary".  By default, a DynamicForm
 * bound to a DataSource with a field of type "binary" will use the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.FileItem}, which displays a standard HTML &lt;input type="upload"&gt; form
 * control. <P> When you call {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.DynamicForm#saveData DynamicForm.saveData} on a
 * DynamicForm containing a FileItem, Smart GWT processes the save identically to a saveData() call that did not include a
 * file upload: <ul> <li> if you are using the built-in SQL connectors via serverType:"sql", the file will be saved to SQL
 * as described under {@link com.smartgwt.client.types.FieldType field type "binary"}. <li> if you have server-side
 * business logic, the inbound request may be routed to your business logic via RPCManager dispatch or DMI declarations as
 * normal, your business logic will receive a normal DSRequest, and you are expected to provide a normal DSResponse. </ul>
 * <P> Client-side callbacks, such as the callback passed to saveData(), fire normally. <P> <b>Processing File Uploads with
 * server-side business logic</b> <P> Server-side business logic that processes file uploads may retrieve upload files via
 * the server side API dsRequest.getUploadedFile(<i>fieldName</i>).  The uploaded file is returned as an instance of
 * ISCFileItem, which provides access to a Java InputStream as well as metadata about the file (size, name).   See the
 * ${isc.DocUtils.linkForDocNode('javaServerReference', 'Java Server Reference')} for details. <P> <span
 * style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">NOTE:</span> request processing engines such as Struts may parse the inbound request
 * before Smart GWT receives it.  If you are creating an RPCManager object inside of a Struts Action and the file being
 * uploaded is not available via <code>dsRequest.getUploadedFile()</code>, this is likely to be the problem, and you should
 * use Smart GWT {@link com.smartgwt.client.docs.DmiOverview DMI} instead. <P> Server-side validation errors may be
 * provided, including validation errors for the uploaded file (such as too large or invalid content), and will be
 * displayed in the form that attempted an upload. <P> Be aware of the following special concerns when processing file
 * uploads: <ul> <li> if you provide your own Java Servlet or JSP that creates an instance of RPCManager in order process
 * Smart GWT requests, many APIs of the HttpServletRequest are not safe to call before you have created the RPCManager,
 * passing in the HttpServletRequest.  These include getReader(), getParameter() and other commonly called methods.  This
 * is a limitation of Java Servlets, not specific to Smart GWT <li> unlike other DataSource "add" and "update" operations,
 * you are not expected to return the file as part of the data returned in the DSResponse </ul> <P> <b>Multi file upload:
 * MultiFileItem</b> <P> The MultiFileItem provides an interface for a user to save one or more files that are related to a
 * DataSource record, where each file is represented by a record in a related DataSource. <P> See the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.MultiFileItem} docs for details. <P> <b>Upload without the Smart GWT Server</b>
 * <P> If it is acceptable that the application will do a full-page reload after the upload completes, you can simply: <ul>
 * <li> set {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.DynamicForm#getEncoding encoding} to "multipart" <li> include an {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.UploadItem} to get a basic HTML upload control <li> set {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.DynamicForm#getAction action} to a URL where you have deployed server-side code to
 * handle the upload <li> call {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.DynamicForm#submitForm DynamicForm.submitForm} to
 * cause the form to be submitted </ul> This cause the DynamicForm component to submit to the form.action URL like an
 * ordinary HTML &lt;form&gt; element.  Many  <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=html+file+upload+example'
 * onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/search?q=html+file+upload+example');return false;">online tutorials</a> are
 * available which explain how to handle HTML form file upload in various server-side technologies. <P> Note that when you
 * submitForm(), the only values that will be sent to your actionURL are  values for which actual FormItems exist.  This
 * differs from saveData(), in which the entire set of {@link com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.DynamicForm#getValues form
 * values} are always sent.  To handle submitting extra values, use {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.HiddenItem}s. <P> For further details, see the {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.fields.UploadItem} docs. <P> <b>Background upload without the Smart GWT Server</b> <P>
 * Achieving background file upload without using the Smart GWT server is also possible although considerably more
 * advanced.  In addition to the steps above, create a hidden &lt;iframe&gt; element in the page, and use {@link
 * com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form.DynamicForm#getTarget target} to target the form submission at this IFRAME.  In order
 * receive a callback notification when the upload completes, after processing the file upload, your server should output
 * HTML content for the IFRAME that includes a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; block which will navigate out of the IFRAME (generally via
 * the JavaScript global "top") and call a global method you have declared as a callback.
