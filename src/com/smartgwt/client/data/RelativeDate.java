     * The value attribute of a RelativeDate object is a string that should be specified in one of 2 formats:
     * <P>
     * There are a number of standard preset shortcut date-offset strings. These include the following
     * <ul>
     * <li> $now - this moment </li>
     * <li> $today - the current day. By default this resolves to the start of the current day though
     * an explicit +link{RelativeDateRangePosition} may be used to specify the end of the current day.</li>
     * <li> $startOfToday - the start of today</li>
     * <li> $endOfToday - the end of today (one millisecond before the $startOfTomorrow) </li>
     * <li> $yesterday - the previous day.</li>
     * <li> $startOfYesterday - the start of yesterday</li>
     * <li> $endOfYesterday - the end of yesterday (one millisecond before the $startOfToday) </li>
     * <li> $tomorrow - the following day</li>
     * <li> $startOfTomorrow - the start of tomorrow </li>
     * <li> $endOfTomorrow - the end of tomorrow </li>
     * <li> $startOfWeek - the start of the current week </li>
     * <li> $endOfWeek - the end of the current week </li>
     * <li> $startOfMonth - the start of the current month </li>
     * <li> $endOfMonth - the end of the current month </li>
     * <li> $startOfYear - the start of the current year </li>
     * <li> $endOfYear - the end of the current year </li>
     * </ul>
     * Note that some shortcuts indicate a time period but do not directly indicate whether the value 
     * refers to the start or end of the time period in question. This 
     * ambiguity can be resolved by specifying an explicit RelativeDateRangePosition when calling APIs
     * that convert from RelativeDates to absolute date values. This is the case for <i>$today</i>, 
     * <i>$tomorrow</i>, <i>$yesterday</i>, <i>$weekAgo</i>, <i>$weekFromNow</i>, <i>$monthAgo</i>
     * and <i>$monthFromNow</i>. If a range position is not explicitly passed, these will all default
     * to the start of the day in question.
     * <P>
     * Alternatively the value can be a special RelativeDateString comprised of the following parts:
     * <ul>
     * <li>direction: the direction in which the quantity applies - one of + or - </li>
     * <li>quantity: the number of units of time to apply - a number </li>
     * <li>timeUnit: an abbreviated timeUnit to use - one of ms/MS (millisecond), s/S (second),
     *      mn/MN (minute), h/H (hour), d/D (day), w/W (week), m/M (month), q/Q (quarter, 3-months),
     *      y/Y (year), dc/DC (decade) or c/C (century). <br>
     *      The timeUnit is case sensitive. A lowercase timeUnit implies an exact offset, so <code>+1d</code>
     *      refers to the current date / time increased by exactly 24 hours. If the timeUnit is
     *      uppercase, it refers to the start or end boundary of the period of time in question, so
     *      <code>+1D</code> would refer to the end of the day (23:39:59:999) tomorrow, and
     *      <code>-1D</code> would refer to the start of the day (00:00:00:000) yesterday.</li>
     * <li>[qualifier]: an optional timeUnit encapsulated in square-brackets and used to offset
     *     the calculation - eg. if +1d is "plus one day", +1d[W] is "plus one day from the
     *     end of the current week".  You may also specify another complete RelativeDateString as the
     *     [qualifier], which offers more control - eg, +1d[+1W] indicates "plus one day from
     *     the end of NEXT week".</li>
     * </ul>
     * <P>
     * This format is very flexible. Here are a few example relative date strings:<br>
     * <code>+0D</code>: End of today. There are often multiple ways to represent the same time
     *  using this system - for example this could also be written as <code>-1ms[+1D]</code><br>
     *  <code>-0D</code>: Beginning of today.<br>
     *  <code>+1W</code>: End of next week.<br>
     *  <code>+1ms[+0W]</code>: Beginning of next week.<br>
     *  <code>+1w[-0D]</code>: Beginning of the current day of next week.
